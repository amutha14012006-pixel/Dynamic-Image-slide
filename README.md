üñºÔ∏è Dynamic Image Slider

A Dynamic Image Slider is an interactive web component designed to display multiple images or banners in a continuous and visually appealing manner. It enhances the user experience by allowing images to slide, fade, or transition smoothly either automatically or through user interaction.

Unlike a static slider, a dynamic image slider automatically updates its content from external sources such as databases, JSON files, or APIs. This means that developers can easily add, remove, or update images without manually changing the HTML structure ‚Äî making it flexible, scalable, and efficient for modern web applications.
